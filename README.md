Swift-Add a map with User Location

# Background information
Time to team up with Marguerite one more time! Now that your rideshare app has a ride history capability, it also needs to be able to order a ride for your user. Within the Swift language work with Marguerite to develop ride request functionality in your app. 

Part of this task includes adding a map showing a userâ€™s location to your app. Once you have tackled this task and the previous one you have taken important steps in developing a rideshare app. Put your UI skills to the test again and help your users get found by our drivers!

# Task Brief
Set Up 
Before you tackle this task, you will need to download and install Xcode from the Mac App store.

Instructions

Open the RideSharer.xcodeproj file in the RideSharer_Map_Start folder.
 
Add a map to the view. Use constraints to make it cover the entire view, like you did with the ride history table view, and similarly create an IBOutlet for it.
 
Get the user's current location and display it on the map.
 
If the user denies location access, show an alert telling the user that they have not provided permission.
 
Run the app and ensure the location request is displayed. Allow the request and see that your location is showing on the map. Reset the location permissions by removing the app, then re-running it. This time, deny permission to track your location. Run the app again and see that the alert is displayed.
